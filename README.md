# BOOK_STORE
This GUI can be used in Book Stores or Libraries to maintain records.
In Python Files folder there is frontend and backend both. 
In Executable files folder you can get .exe file and also pre stored .db file which can be ignored if you want to create new database.
This small project is made using Python3 and it's Tkinter library for GUI and Sqlite3 DataBase, I will update it soon to Postgresql.
